How to Play

Every square has a name like “a2” or “f7” (letter = column, number = row).
To move, type the square your piece is on, then the square you want it to go to.

Example:
a2a4 → move the piece from a2 to a4.

Make sure: 
All letters are lowercase. 
There are no spaces in the move

If you want to quit the match, type r or R.
